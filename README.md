# Life Fitness

This is a simple project about __KEEPING HEALTHY__ by training or exercising all the time. The application was developed using **Ruby on Rails 5** to help others learn the RoR framework especially the students I am mentoring in __OpenClassrooms__ who are taking the Fullstack path.

* ### The Login Page
The application has a nice UI and the login page is an example of it as seen with the image below.

* ### The Dashboard
The *__Dashboard__* serves as the central location or area, where other actions can be performed. Menu or navigation items shown here is strictly based on the type of Role the current user has. See the below image.

# Usage
You are free to clone the project, modify it, and extend it as far as you can and even to the extent of commercializing it. All I need from you is an acknowledgement of my initiative.

# The HTML Theme Used
  I have combined two different themes in order to get the look and feel I wanted for the application. 
  These two themes in question are;
  
* ### Chain Responsive Bootstrap3 Admin Template
  This is the main template used for the rest of the application apart from the home page or landing page. Click **[here](http://themetrace.com/demo/chain/)** to preview the original template.

* ### Fitnezz Website Template
  The Fitnezz template was also used in designing the landing or home page. You can also preview it **[here](https://colorlib.com/preview/theme/fitnezz/)**

## Caution!!
  Please note that I have greatly modified some of the CSS and JS file within the two templates and at some points, I have written my     own scripts to handle the kind of effect I wanted and so, if you don't find or see such effect with the original theme, don't be         alarmed.
    
  Thanks for the understanding!
