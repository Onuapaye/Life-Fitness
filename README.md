# Life Fitness

This is a simple project about KEEPING HEALTHY by training or exercising all the time. The application was developed using Ruby on Rails (5) to help others learn the RoR framework especially the students I am mentoring in OpenClassrooms who are taking the Fullstack path.

### The Login Page
The application has a nice UI and the login page is an example of it as seen with the image below.

### The Dashboard
The dash board serves as the central location or area, where other actions can be performed. Menu or navigation items shown here is strictly based on the type of Role the current user has. See the below image.

## Usage
You are free to clone the project, modify it, and extend it as far as you can and even to the extent of commercializing it. All I need from you is an acknowledgement of my initiative.

# The HTML Theme Used
I have combined two different themes in order to get the look and feel I wanted for the application. These two themes in question are;
* ### Chain Responsive Bootstrap3 Admin Template
This is the main template used for the rest of the application apart from the home page or landing page. Click on [here]http://themetrace.com/demo/chain/ to preview the original template.

* ### Fitnezz Website Template
The Fitnezz template was also used in designing the landing or home page. You can also preview it [here] https://colorlib.com/preview/theme/fitnezz/
